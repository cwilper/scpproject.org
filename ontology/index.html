#    Semantic Content Package OWL-Lite Ontology     #
#            DRAFT, 2012-04-13, cwilper             #
#                                                   #
# SCP defines a minimal RDF vocabulary in order to: #
#                                                   #
#   o  Provide a uniform, but OPTIONAL way to refer #
#      to content within a package so it can be     #
#      described by other, more appropriate         #
#      vocabularies.                                #
#                                                   #
#   o  Allow packages to declare the compound data  #
#      models, if any, to which they conform.       #
#                                                   #

# Classes
#

# A specific sequence of octets that exists conceptually regardless
# of where the content might be found. The "location" property
# refers to a ContentLocation. A Bytestream may refer to any number
# of ContentLocations.
scp:Bytestream      rdf:type        owl:Class .

# Indicates where the content of a Bytestream is expected to be found.
# Two subclasses are defined.
scp:ContentLocation rdf:type        owl:Class .

# A kind of ContentLocation with a URI that can be dereferenced.
scp:ResolvableURI   rdfs:subClassOf scp:ContentLocation .

# A kind of ContentLocation that points to a path within a package.
# The "path" property refers to a Plain Literal value, such as
# "path/to/file.txt", and the "inPackage" property refers to the
# Package.
scp:PackagePath     rdfs:subClassOf scp:ContentLocation .

# A container for content and statements. The "type" property refers
# to a PackageType. A Package may assert that it has any number of
# PackageTypes.
scp:Package         rdf:type        owl:Class .

# A particular kind of package. Some sort of data model is usually
# associated with a PackageType, but the means by which package types
# are described or represented is not expected to be uniform, nor
# is a method suggested by the SCP specification.
scp:PackageType     rdf:type        owl:Class .
